//! **⚠️ Might be undocumented. This driver itself is not used in the project, but instead the
//! [SSD1803A controller](super::ssd1803a) is used. It's mostly compatible with HD44780, but has some
//! additional features. Look there for detailed documentation. This is mostly archival at the moment.**
